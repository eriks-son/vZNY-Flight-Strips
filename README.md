# vZNY Flight Strips

This project streamlines the job of a Clearance Delivery controller in the Virtual NYARTCC and any controller controlling multiple airports top down.

A slightly changed alias file is included that adds a couple of necessary clearances for smaller airports. Not necessary but pdcs for some airports (KISP, KSWF, etc.) will not work and will need to be written manually in your client.

The Netlify deploy can be found here: https://main--rococo-elf-13b320.netlify.app/
